# Module-3-Challenge-Homework

For this week's homework, we were given the task of creating a random password generator. The main focus of this homework is to have a pop up show up when the user clicks on the generate button. This pop up would then ask if the user would like their password to contain different variables such as, upper and lower cases, numbers and special characters. Once the user finishes with the pop up demands, a password is then generated. The user's answer in the pop up is what allows the code to run through the series of functions to generate the random password.
